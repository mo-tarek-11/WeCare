Website for Chronic disease prediction using machine learning Include: (Heart, Kidney, C, Diabetes) 
The project's goal is to create a website that uses machine learning to identify chronic illnesses. It was developed using the Python programming language and the RNF and KNN algorithms. On the other hand, the creation of a website optimized for screens on laptops and smartphones. 
The website is simple and quick to use. When a user opens the website, selects their preferred disease, and inputs their symptoms, the website determines whether or not the user is ill. In case the user is ill, the website will offer a treatment along with an appropriate dosage; if not, the user will provide guidance. As a PDF file, your report is also viewable and printable.
